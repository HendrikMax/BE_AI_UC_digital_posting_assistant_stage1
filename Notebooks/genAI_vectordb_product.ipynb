    "Storing vector embeddings within the same database is a strategic move that aligns seamlessly with SAP's commitment to providing a unified platform. This integration eliminates the hurdles posed by data silos, offering a holistic approach to data management. In SAP HANA Cloud, the storage of vector embeddings is seamlessly integrated into the platform's existing structure, allowing users to store them in a designated table. Developers can perform SQL-like queries effortlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can execute joins, apply filters, and perform selects by combining vector embeddings with various data types, including transactional, spatial, graph, and JSON data, all within the same SQL environment. The Vector Engine ensures a user-friendly experience, eliminating the need for extensive learning or the adoption of new querying methodologies. Essentially, working with vector embeddings in SAP HANA Cloud is as straightforward as crafting queries in a standard SQL database, offering familiarity and ease of use for developers. -->\n",

    "Storing vector embeddings within the same database is a strategic move that aligns seamlessly with SAP's commitment to providing a unified platform. This integration eliminates the hurdles posed by data silos, offering a holistic approach to data management. In SAP HANA Cloud, the storage of vector embeddings is seamlessly integrated into the platform's existing structure, allowing users to store them in a designated table. Developers can perform SQL-like queries effortlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can execute joins, apply filters, and perform selects by combining vector embeddings with various data types, including transactional, spatial, graph, and JSON data, all within the same SQL environment. The Vector Engine ensures a user-friendly experience, eliminating the need for extensive learning or the adoption of new querying methodologies. Essentially, working with vector embeddings in SAP HANA Cloud is as straightforward as crafting queries in a standard SQL database, offering familiarity and ease of use for developers."
