      "\n",

      "   - **Type I Supernova**: This occurs in binary star systems where one star is a white dwarf. If the white dwarf accumulates enough mass from its companion star, it can reach a critical limit (the Chandrasekhar limit) and undergo a thermonuclear explosion.\n",
      "   - **Type II Supernova**: This happens when a massive star (typically more than eight times the mass of the Sun) exhausts its nuclear fuel. The core collapses under gravity, leading to a catastrophic explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Process**:\n",
      "   - In a Type II supernova, as the star runs out of fuel, it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse. The core collapses, and the outer layers are expelled into space.\n",
      "   - In a Type I supernova, the white dwarf's mass increases until it can no longer support itself, leading to a runaway nuclear reaction.\n",
