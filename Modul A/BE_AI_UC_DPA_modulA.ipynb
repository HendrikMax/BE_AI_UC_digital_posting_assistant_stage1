    "Retriever Initialization: The db.as_retriever function is used to initialize a retriever object with specific search arguments ('k':20), which likely defines the number of search results to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Template : The PromptTemplate was defined in the previous step that instructs how to use the context to answer a question. It emphasizes not to fabricate answers if the information is unavailable. The template also outlines the structure for the expected JSON output with various product and supplier details.The prompt template is crucial for guiding the model's responses, ensuring that the answers are relevant and accurate based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the retriever and prompt template are set up, the next step involves using the LLM (Language Model) to generate answers based on the retrieved documents. This process typically includes passing the retrieved context to the LLM along with the user's query, allowing it to formulate a coherent and contextually appropriate response.After that, the LLM processes the prompt and generates a response, which can then be formatted and returned to the user, ensuring a seamless interaction with the QA system."
